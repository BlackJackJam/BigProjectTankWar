# BigProjectTankWar
Another assignment from my C++ class

## Description
The Tank War is a tiny game based on console system.
In this project, you should use the basic version and sample code of this game given by the TA, modify it and add some new features to it.
New features includes but not limited to strategy for enemy tanks, scoring systems, life counting systems and special items on the battle field.

## Something you should know
Basically, this project will be based on EasyX, however, if possible, other SDK for image display is acceptable.
Also, if possible, I want this game to become a system app.
